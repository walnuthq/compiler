/// An [Interface] is a modular abstraction operation, i.e. it is designed to model groups of
/// related functionality meant to be produced/consumed together.
///
/// An [Interface] itself represents a shared-nothing boundary, i.e. the functionality it exports
/// uses the Canonical ABI of the Wasm Component Model. However, it is possible for a [Component]
/// to export multiple interfaces which are implemented within the same shared-everything boundary.
/// Even when that is the case, calls to any [Interface] export from within that boundary, will
/// still be treated as crossing a shared-nothing boundary. In this way, components can both define
/// and re-export interfaces from other components, without callers needing to know where the
/// actual definition is provided from.
///
/// Interfaces correspond to component _instances_ exported from a component _definition_ in the
/// Wasm Component Model. This means that they are almost identical concepts, however we distinguish
/// between [Component] and [Interface] in the IR to better model the relationships between these
/// concepts, as well as to draw a connection to interfaces in WIT (WebAssembly Interface Types).
///
/// ## Contents
///
/// Interfaces may only contain [Function] items, and may only _export_ functions with the
/// `CanonLift` calling convention. It is expected that these functions will rely on implementation
/// details defined in a sibling [Module], though that is not strictly required.
